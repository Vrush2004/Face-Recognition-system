   'how does facial recognition work': 'Facial recognition technology identifies individuals by capturing an image, detecting the face, extracting unique features, and creating a numerical representation (face vector). This vector is compared against a database to verify or identify the person. The system outputs whether a match is found and may provide additional details. Common applications include security, user verification, and social media tagging.',
   'how does facial recognition work step by step': '1) Image Capture: A camera captures a face.\n2) Face Detection: Algorithms locate the face in the image.\n3) Landmark Detection: Key facial features are identified.\n4) Feature Extraction: Unique facial characteristics are extracted.\n5) Encoding: Features are converted into a numerical representation (face vector).\n6) Matching: The face vector is compared to a database of templates.\n7) Decision Making: The system determines if thereâ€™s a match.\n8) Output: The result indicates whether a match is found.',
